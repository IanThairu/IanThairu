### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Ian Thairu
#### I solve business problems using data
I have always enjoyed subjects that require strong numerical ability and logical reasoning skills. This led me to pursue a bachelors degree in Economics and Statistics, where my favorite units were Math and Statistics-related. My first experience with programming was love at first sight. I started with JavaScript and later taught myself Python and R which were more relevant to my field.

Besides my technical abilities, I have also developed a strong business acumen, sales experience and soft skills from different work experiences. I have been an entrepreneur, a sales intern in an investment bank and currently a lead generation expert.

I keep educating and refining myself to become a more productive person. Currently pursuing a Masters in Financial Engineering and other certifications to enhance my skills. Particularly interested in applying my skills in the fields of data science, finance and sales.

Skills: Excel, SQL, Power BI, Tableau, Cloud Computing with Azure, Machine Learning, Financial Analysis, Corporate Finance and pricing and trading of securities
